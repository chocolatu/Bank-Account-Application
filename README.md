# Bank-Account-Application

## Scenario: You are a back-end developer and need to create an application to handle new customer bank account requests.

The application should do the following:

Read a .csv file of names, social security numbers, account type, and initial deposit

Use a proper data structure to hold all these accounts

Both savings and checking accounts share the following properties:

deposit()

withdraw()

transfer()

showInfo() 

11-digit Account Number (generated with the following process:1 or 2 depending on Savings or Checking, last two digits of SSN, unique 5-digit number, and random 3-digit number)

Savings Account holders are given a Safety Deposit Box, identified by 3-digit number and accessed with a 4-digit code.

Checking Account holders are assigned a Debit Card with a 12-digit number and 4-digit PIN 

Both account will use an interface that determines the base interest rate.

Savings accounts will use .25 points less than the base rate

Checking accounts will use 13% of the base rate

The showInfo method should reveal relevant account information as well as information specific to the Checking account or Savings account.

## What I learned from this project:
Learn to develop a robust application architecture

Use when to use abstract classes and abstract methods

Use an interface API to receive information from a developer’s application

Explore constructors deeper and use the super() keyword

Explore access modifiers and when to use public, private, or protected

Read data from a file and store in an appropriate data structure

Generate random numbers and work with String API
